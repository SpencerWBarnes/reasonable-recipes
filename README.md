# reasonable-recipes
A Minecraft datapack adding various recipes to make some items craftable or more accessible.

Some items are rather difficult to acquire, either not being craftable at all or requiring expensive resources. This results in some decoration techniques going unused or certain mechanics being inviable.

> **NOTE:** This datapack is solely a personal project. The recipes contained do not necessarily relate to each other, and this datapack will not be reliably maintained.

# Non-craftable Recipes

### Pottery sherds

In lore these are rare and ancient, with a fun archeology component! However, finding and successfully unearthing sherds is a massive time sink to acquire a single sherd not to mention unsustainable on a multiplayer server. Archeology is difficult enough in the real world- let's not bring that to Minecraft.

**The fix:** A cheap recipe to duplicate a sherd, paired with an expensive recipe to create a sherd.

### Gilded Blackstone

A fun decoration block that cannot be crafted without clear reason why.

**The fix:** A recipe at the cost of being at a gold loss.

<details>
<summary>Recipe details and demos</summary>

> Mining a gilded blackstone block will give 5 gold nuggets at most, regardless of the level of fortune enchantments (as of v1.21.3).

### Glow Ink Sac

An item that many would eventually accrue after enough caving or aquifer diving. However, builders with an interest in signs will quickly run out without an interesting way to get more. Expanding the number of recipes with another glowing material adds different paths of acquiring this item.

**The fix:** A recipe using ink sac and a glowing material.

<summary>Recipe details and demos</summary>

> A simple shapeless recipe containing an ink sac and a glowing material (glowstone dust, glowberry, or glow lichen).

### Sand

Sand and glass are central to many decorations and recipes. yet are one of the only non-renewable natural blocks. Sand is largely quartz and between gravel and clay in coarseness, so a vanilla style recipe can be extrapolated from established recipes like coarse dirt, diorite, and granite.

**The fix:** A diorite copy-cat recipe reflecting natural sand processes.

# Recipe Variants

### Minecart rails

Minecarts and rails do not get used much with the rapid consumption of iron and gold being a major reason. Expanding the number of recipes for rails to use another metal ore will help make them usable in the early game.

**The fix:** Add recipe variants that use copper at the cost of crafting fewer rails.

<details>
<summary>Recipe details and demos</summary>

> All rail recipes have a variant with copper ingots replacing the metal ingots of the vanilla recipe. Replacing iron results in half (1/2) the number of rails.

> ![Activator rail recipe with copper ingots replacing iron ingots, resulting in three rails](/static/activator_rail.png)
>
> Replacing gold results in a third (1/3) the number of rails.

### Leads and Sticky Pistons

These items consume slimeballs. While less of an issue with the addition of the Potion of Oozing, slimes and slime chunks are unpleasant to search for. Expanding the number of recipes with another related sticky material of similar rarity adds different paths of acquiring these items.

**The fix:** Add recipe variants that use honey bottles.

### Lodestones

Lodestones are a fun way of navigating to keep players immersed without using coordinates. A netherite ingot?! Does _anyone_ any these things with that sort of cost? Using a compass in place of a netherite ingot leans into the lore of syncing a compass to point towards a lodestone.

> Ha! Mojang agreed with me and as of Snapshot 25w02a updated the recipe to be even cheaper, with an iron ingot. Leaving this recipe as is until the new recipe is officially released, then I will remove it.

**The fix:** Add a recipe that uses a compass.
