# reasonable-recipes
A Minecraft datapack adding various recipes to make some items craftable or more accessible.

Some items are rather difficult to acquire, either not being craftable at all or requiring expensive resources. This results in some decoration techniques going unused or certain mechanics being inviable.

> **NOTE:** This datapack is solely a personal project. The recipes contained do not necessarily relate to each other, and this datapack will not be reliably maintained.

# Non-craftable Recipes

### Pottery sherds

In lore these are rare and ancient, with a fun archeology component! However, finding and successfully unearthing sherds is a massive time sink to acquire a single sherd not to mention unsustainable on a multiplayer server. Archeology is difficult enough in the real world- let's not bring that to Minecraft.

**The fix:** An expensive recipe to create a sherd, paired with a cheap recipe to duplicate a sherd.

### Gilded Blackstone

A fun decoration block that cannot be crafted without clear reason why.

**The fix:** A recipe at the cost of being at a gold loss.

---

### Glow Ink Sac

An item that many would eventually accrue after enough caving or aquifer diving. However, builders with an interest in signs will quickly run out without an interesting way to get more. Expanding the number of recipes with another glowing material adds different paths of acquiring this item.

**The fix:** A recipe using ink sac and a glowing material.

# Recipe Variants

### Minecart rails

Minecarts and rails don't see the light much with the rapid consumption of iron and gold being a major reason. Expanding the number of recipes for rails to use another metal ore will help make them usable in the early game.

**The fix:** Add recipe variants that use copper at the cost of crafting fewer rails.

### Leads and Sticky Pistons

These items consume slimeballs. While less of an issue with the addition of the Potion of Oozing, slimes and slime chunks are unpleasant to search for. Expanding the number of recipes with another related sticky material of similar rarity adds different paths of acquiring these items.

**The fix:** Add recipe variants that use honey bottles.

---

### Lodestones

Lodestones are a fun way of navigating to keep players immersed without using coordinates. A netherite ingot?! Does _anyone_ any these things with that sort of cost? Using a compass in place of a netherite ingot leans into the lore of syncing a compass to point towards a lodestone.

**The fix:** Add a recipe that uses a compass.
